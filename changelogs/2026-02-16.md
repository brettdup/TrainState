🔹 Request

User requested that the improved card appearance be the default style for all cards.

🔧 Changes Made
	•	Promoted elevated glass card styling to the app-wide default:
	•	Updated `GlassCardModifier` default `prominence` from `regular` to `elevated`.
	•	Updated `glassCard(...)` extension default `prominence` from `regular` to `elevated`.
	•	This makes existing `.glassCard()` call sites across the app automatically use the clearer, higher-contrast card style.

Files modified:
	•	TrainState/Views/Components/LiquidGlass.swift

✅ Result

The preferred card look is now the global default for all glass-styled cards without requiring per-view overrides.

	•	Replaced decorative main background gradient with a flatter base (`systemGroupedBackground` in light mode).
	•	Kept only a very subtle top accent fade for depth without noise.
	•	Increased elevated card separation in shared glass styling:
	•	Light mode elevated cards now use higher-opacity white fills.
	•	Elevated card borders in light mode now use subtle dark strokes (instead of bright white) for clearer edge definition.
	•	Retained elevated shadow behavior to preserve depth hierarchy on the main list.

	•	Workout rows in `WorkoutRowView`
	•	Workout list helper cards in `WorkoutListView` (limits/rate/checklist cards)
	•	Kept default `regular` styling for other screens so the app does not become visually heavy everywhere.
