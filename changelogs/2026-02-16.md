🔹 Request

User reported that cards were not adapting correctly in dark mode, causing poor contrast and unreadable content.

🔧 Changes Made
	•	Updated shared `glassCard` styling to use adaptive system backgrounds instead of a hardcoded white card surface.
	•	Added dark-mode-aware border and shadow tuning in the shared card modifiers for better separation without washing out text.
	•	Updated `ExerciseCardView` to default to the environment color scheme instead of forcing light mode when no override is provided.
	•	Adjusted exercise card background colors to semantic system surfaces for consistent readability in both light and dark mode.

Files modified:
	•	TrainState/Views/Components/LiquidGlass.swift
	•	TrainState/Theme/AppCardStyle.swift
	•	TrainState/Views/Components/ExerciseCardView.swift

✅ Result

Cards now adapt to light and dark mode correctly, and card content remains readable with proper foreground/background contrast across shared card surfaces.
