# App Growth and Premium Roadmap

This document turns the strategy into an execution checklist we can implement one item at a time.

## How We Will Work Through This

1. Pick one item.
2. Implement it.
3. Measure impact for 7-14 days.
4. Keep, iterate, or revert based on results.

## 1) Strengthen the Core Habit Loop

Goal: make users log consistently and feel immediate progress.

- [x] Reduce log flow to under 15 seconds for common workout types.

- [x] Add smart reminders based on missed routine windows.

Success metrics:
- Time-to-log
- Workouts per active user per week
- D7 retention

## 2) Position Premium Around Outcomes

- [ ] Gate export/share reporting features.

Success metrics:
- Premium feature tap-through rate
- Trial start rate from premium feature entry points

## 3) Improve Paywall Timing and Messaging

Goal: show paywall at high-intent moments.

- [ ] Add annual plan anchor and free-trial framing.

Success metrics:

## 6) Improve First-3-Day Onboarding Retention

Goal: increase early retention and future premium conversion.

- [x] Add first-session checklist (log workout, set goal, reminders).

Success metrics:

## 7) Run Weekly Experiments

Goal: systematically optimize growth and monetization.

Experiment ideas:
- [ ] Paywall headline variants
